# Collabfield

**Collabfield** is my second Ruby on Rails project. My first project was the [Getting Started Blog](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html), which helped me become familiar with the Rails basics.

For this project, I'm following the guide from freeCodeCamp:  
👉 [Let’s Create an Intermediate Level Ruby on Rails Application](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lets-create-an-intermediate-level-ruby-on-rails-application-d7c6e997c63f/)

## 🚀 Purpose

This app is part of my personal learning journey while doing an internship at **Ingent**. My goal is to deepen my understanding of Ruby on Rails by building something more advanced and hands-on, going beyond just following tutorials.

I started feeling the typical **"tutorial hell"** — the loop of watching and reading too much without enough real-world practice. This project is my way of breaking out of that and building something practical, one step at a time.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Ruby on Rails 7
- PostgreSQL
- Devise (planned)
- ActionCable (planned for real-time messaging)
- Docker (optional for containerized development)

---

## 🧩 Features (Planned)

- User authentication with Devise
- Creating and categorizing posts
- Private and group chat with popup messaging
- Contact system to connect with other users
- Real-time notifications

## 📌 Status

Currently under development. Initial setup completed with PostgreSQL and Rails.

## 🧠 Reflections

Building this app from scratch is already much faster than my first one, and I'm working on it independently — which feels great! I'm using Git and GitHub for version control, and planning to document key parts of the journey here.
